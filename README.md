# INPAINTING 3D CNN + GAN 


Implementation of a 3D Convolutional Neural Network that can fill missing measurment of variables in a parallelepiped of the Mediterranean sea by using the so called inpainting technique.
A local and a global discriminator are implemented to ensure the correcteness of the prediction.
